# Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
# Example 2:

# Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
# Output: 9
 

# Constraints:

# n == height.length
# 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
# 0 <= height[i] <= 105

class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(height) < 3:
            return 0
        
        n = len(height)
        left_max = [0] * n
        right_max = [0] * n
        answer = 0

        left_max[0] = height[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            left_max[i] = max(left_max[i-1], height[i])

        right_max[n-1] = height[n-1]
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            right_max[i] = max(right_max[i+1], height[i])

        for i in range(n):
            answer += min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i]
        
        return answer
