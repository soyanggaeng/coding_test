# Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

# You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
# Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
# Example 2:

# Input: head = [2,1], x = 2
# Output: [1,2]
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# -200 <= x <= 200

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: Optional[ListNode], x: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # 2 dummy nodes
        less_head = ListNode(0)
        greater_head = ListNode(0)

        # 2 pointers for last nodes of each head
        less = less_head
        greater = greater_head

        while head:
            if head.val < x:
                less.next = head
                less = less.next
            else:
                greater.next = head
                greater = greater.next
            head = head.next

        # connect the two lists
        less.next = greater_head.next
        greater.next = None
        
        # The new head of the partitioned list
        return less_head.next
